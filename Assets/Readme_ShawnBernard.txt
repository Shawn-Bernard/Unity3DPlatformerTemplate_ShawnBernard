How the mechanic works?
My jetpack mechanic kind of works like a state machine where each of the inputs changes the state like hover, ascend and descend. When first starting this wasn't the plan, I originally tackled one problem at a time so hover was the first one and it took me a few days to figure out what feels the best when moving in the air. I tried turning off gravity and messing a lot with force modes until I found the one that felt the best, which was acceleration because it felt more consistent with air time and easier to control and manage. When I started doing other states I just thought about cars and gear shifts, I've done something similar before and knew how I could set it up.   

What dynamics arose when you added this mechanic?
When doing level design project I kind of cut a lot push/dragging box section only because it felt horrible slow and clunky, but having a jetpack while moving the boxes actual felt good again and fun. I do wish I added more like my rope idea I forgot about... and dropping bomb while flying would've added more interesting dynamics, I still think picking up boxes and dropping them is fun tho. The were enemies kinda lame before but you can fly over them now yay! Not much of a dynamic change besides how combat section layouts could change. Again not much dynamic change when it comes to grounded objects like water and mud, I think instead of dynamics changes with others mechanics it changes a lot more of the options with level designs unfortunately.    

How does the mechanic feel to interact with and does it match your intent?
The mechanic feels goodish. I did kinda want it to feel like the game Control hover in terms of feedback and animation. I think it controls great but is lacking more refined player feedback, but as a prototype it's good.
